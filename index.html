    <h1>The power of positive thinking </h1>
    <p class="p1">The power of positive thinking is remarkable.
      In fact, the idea that your mind can change your world almost seems too good to be true.
      I can assure you, however, that I have experienced AND witnessed the good and positive light that having a positive mindset can bring.
      Both positive and negative thoughts are powerful but have opposite results. Today I want to talk to you about how both can impact you, and how the power of positive thinking can truly transform every aspect of your life.
        </p><br>

    <p class="p2">Positive thinking means you look for solutions and expect to find them.
      You donâ€™t ignore problems, but instead of complaining about them or letting them overpower you, you actively look for ways to overcome them. You take responsibility for your life on a consistent basis because you understand you are in control of how your life progresses.
      A positive thinker finds the benefits â€” or the bright side â€” of challenges and expects things to work out well.
      Weâ€™ve all felt a rush of energy after hearing a speech on the benefits of positive thinking, so let that be your sign that it works!
      Having a positive attitude means you have an optimistic outlook. An optimistic attitude means you have hope. You believe things will work out well and ultimately you will have success.
      Scientists have been studying the health benefits of positive thinking for a long time. Research suggests that positive optimistic people tend to have better mental health and physical health and even live longer.

    <p class="p3">Having a positive outlook can give you a reduced risk of having a heart attack, getting a cold, and being depressed.
      Positive thinking can lower a personâ€™s risk of death from serious illnesses, including cancer, infections, heart disease, stroke, and lung conditions. It improves the outcomes of patients with brain tumors and traumatic brain injury and boosts your immune system.
      A positive state of mind even gives you a higher pain tolerance.
      When you have a positive outlook, you are better equipped to take action, cope with stress and hardships, think more creatively, and be better at problem-solving.
      hinking positively puts you in a better mood and as a result, helps you to form positive relationships with co-workers, family members, friends, and new acquaintances.</p>
